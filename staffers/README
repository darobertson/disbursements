This directory contains data, and scripts to compile this data, for a separate project, a searchable directory of House staffers.  The repository for that web app is separate, at http://github.com/sunlightlabs/staffers.

Process:

1) Place the most current version of the data files into a folder in this directory named "data". Create it if it does not exist. The current data lives in our internal Labs Dropbox (TODO: put these up on S3).

2) Take the disbursements detail file for *new quarters only* (so usually this will be the most recent quarter), and run it through 1_positions.rb. 

  ./1_positions.rb [details-filename.csv]

This will blindly append *all* new staff records from the details file (where the category is "PERSONNEL COMPENSATION") to positions.csv.

3) Run 2_staffers.rb. This will extract unique new staffer names from positions.csv (that don't yet appear in staffers.csv), and append them to staffers.csv.

4) Run 3_offices.rb. This will extract unique new office names from positions.csv (that don't yet appear in offices.csv, and aren't member offices), and append them to offices.csv.

5) Run 4_titles.rb. This will extract all unique new titles from positions.csv (that don't yet appear in titles.csv), and append them to titles.csv.


They're broken out as they are so that the standard names of staffers, titles, and offices, if known, can be changed by hand, and this knowledge preserved going forward. Any changes to the standardized names and titles should be committed to source control.
