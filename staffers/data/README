These CSVs are kept up to date both automatically and by hand. The titles, offices, and staffers CSV files exist to give us a place to offer "standardized" names that each originally appearing name can map to. This is done for readability, and to collapse entities that go by various names into one name.

If you are viewing this your browser and wish to download the CSV files, and are not familiar with git or source control, you can download each one by clicking on their filenames above, right-clicking the "raw" link on that page, and selecting "Save As...".
