This repository contains various scripts for manipulating the House's release of disbursment reports, as retrievable from http://disbursements.house.gov.

It also includes the bulk archives that result from these scripts' various transformations and standardizations.  Some of these transformations are fully automated; some are the result of accumulated human improvement.  Look to the README in each folder for more details.
