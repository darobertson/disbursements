This script was used to convert the 2009 Q3 House Disbursement PDF into detail and summary CSV files.

    Source PDF: http://disbursements.house.gov/
    Resulting Data: http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/projects/2009/expenditures/

It was originally authored by Luke Rosiak with improvements by James Turk for Sunlight Labs and is released into the public domain.

Disclaimer: It was written quickly under deadline and likely contains a few bugs - patches welcome

It expects a file (named in the disbursements_file variable below) created as the result of something like the following two operations:
    
    pdftk 2010q1_singlevolume.pdf cat 10-3613 output disbursements-only.pdf
    
    pdftotext -layout disbursements-only.pdf


Update the:
  * disbursements_file variable (input file, e.g. '2010q2-disbursements-only.txt')
  * year (e.g. '2009', '2010')
  * quarter (e.g. 'Q1', 'Q2')
